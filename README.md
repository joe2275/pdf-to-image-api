# PDF To Image API - Python

![Image Icon showing PDF to Image](images/convert.jpg?raw=true "PDF to Image Banner")


## Overview

Due to the pandemic we have found ourselves sharing PDFs more than ever. However still some people face problem understanding the PDF file or opening the same on a compatible app. In all most applications, a person can view a page in the app itself, without installing a different application all together.   

To enable the same, [@formula21](https://formula21.github.io) has bought you an API which accepts a PDF file only to convert its page(s) to high quality image(s).

Built in Python and deployed through Flask Server, the integrated experience is tailored to any user(s) experience.

## App Documentation

### The Routes

#### `POST /upload`

`body`:
- `file`: Accepts a PDF documents.

`parameters`
- `page`: Accepts a range from `0` to `(total number of pages - 1)`
    - The property is optional, and will by default is assumed `0`.
- `bundle`: Accepts 0 or 1.
  - The property is optional, and will be ignored if not present.


### Explaining the parameters
#### A. The `page` parameter

>:memo: Note this parameter is conditionally mandatory.

The `page` parameter is an integer, which accepts a range between 0 and one less than the last page number of the PDF. 

- If `0` is given to the `page` parameter, the image for the first page is rendered.

- To generate the last page of a 5-page PDF file, passing `page=4` does the job.

> :bulb: **Tip:** Without the `bundle` parameter, only the `page` parameter **will always render an image**. 

#### B. The `bundle` parameter:
The `bundle` parameter is an integer which is actually a binary i.e. accepts either 0 or 1:

- If `0` is passed with a `page = 2` of a 5-page PDF file, then a zip file containing the images of all pages i.e. Page 1, Page 2, Page 3 will be generated.

- If `1` is passed with a `page=2` of a 5-page PDF file, then a zip file containing the images of all pages i.e. Page 3, Page 4, Page 5 will be generated.

- Concluding, `0` renders the left batch of images up to (and inclusive of) the given page number, while `1` renders the right batch of images from the given page number, till the last page of the PDF.

> :bulb: **Tip:** Specifying `bundle` will always force the output to be a **ZIP file of images**, even if there is only 1 page.

>:memo: Without specifying the `page` parameter, but specifying `bundle=0`, does not render any images.

### The Response

#### `200` Ok:

In general the response from the API is an image, however if `bundle` is provided, we expect a ZIP file.

#### `400` Bad Request:

If the file is invalid, or the path is not defined by the API.

#### `500` Internal Server Error.

If there is some problem with the code.
